# Colonist

[Colonist](https://colonist.io) is an online board game based on the popular game Catan. The game is
played by 3 or 4 players, each one with the objective of being the first to reach 10 victory points.
The game is played on a board composed of hexagonal tiles, each one representing a terrain type.
Each terrain type produces a resource, and the players can build settlements and cities on the
vertices of the tiles to collect the resources. The players can also build roads on the edges of the
tiles to connect their settlements and cities. The players can trade resources with each other, and
they can also trade with the bank. The players can also buy development cards, which can give them
victory points or special abilities. The players can also build the longest road and the largest
army, which give them extra victory points.

The purpose of this project is to create a simple recreation of the game Colonist that allows the
players to play the game, using good practices of software development. The application will be
developed using the programming language Scala, various design patterns, and it will be based on the
MVC architecture and test-driven development, using the MUnit library.

## Design patterns to implement:

- [x] Singleton: for the bank to be unique.

- [ ] Factory: for the cards to be created by the bank and given to the players.

- [ ] State: for the game flow to be controlled by the state of the game.

- [ ] Observer: for the players to observe the board and take resources from it when the dice are
  thrown and the number of the hexagon matches the number thrown. Also, to check if a player has 
  reached 10 victory points and won the game.

- [ ] Builder: for the board to be built in a step-by-step process.
